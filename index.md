Are you looking for someone who plans, implements and maintains the information technology, which includes computers, networks, servers, backup, security, cloud, web presence and possibly the phone system, for your organization, business, or "only" your home?  
Are you looking for solutions of your tasks and not just boxes under your desk?  
Do you want a system that is tailored to you and not simply off the shelf?  
Do you think your organically grown IT system is more complex than it needs to be?  
Does your computer misbehave?  
Are you looking for someone combining native knowledge of the German language, culture and IT/telecom market with reasonable English language and international team work experience?

Then ask me. Utilize broad knowledge from more than three decades of experience in information technology. Probably I have already seen a situation like yours and know the hidden challenges and opportunities. Numerous, including international, activities for various christian organizations, have made me acquainted with their special needs, especially regarding security and budget.

By having a part time employment, I don't have to rely on getting the most money out of you. Instead I can offer solutions that cause little effort and are thus efficient for you.

If you are looking for a German in Germany for managing events, having an address in Germany or similar tasks, I can recommend my wife's [BÃ¼roservice Marion Stut](http://www.marion-stut.de) (German language only).
