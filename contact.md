To make work harder for automatic spam address collectors, I have replaced all special characters by embraced words: (ät) stands for @ , (hyphen) stands for - , (point) stands for . Please also omit any spaces - email addresses never contain spaces. When the address mentioned above starts receiving too much spam email, I'll change it within a short time.
