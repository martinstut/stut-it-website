title: "Values"
---
I am striving to let Jesus Christ shape the values I'm working by. Therefore

* I'll tell you up front what time and cost you need to expect and in what areas my estimation is uncertain.
* I'll look for solutions that offer you the best effort-utility ratio, not the most revenue for me.
* I'll cooperate fully if e.g. you want to switch away from me to a different provider.
* I'll tell you not only the advantages, but also the disadvantages of several options.
* I'll tell you not only what I can do, but also what I cannot do (well).
* I'll tell you early on when trouble, e.g. delay or a programming bug, is about to arise.

Some solutions turn out to be less than perfect in the long run. Therefore

* I tend to offer simple solutions, covering 70 % of the features with 10 % of the effort, but do work predictably and reliably.
* I make sure you'll stay independent of vendors, which often leads to open source solutions.
* I care about the effort to replace the system 5 or 15 years from now.

Christian organizations often have to get along with a very small budget. Therefore

* I tend to prefer low cost open source solutions.
* I charge different hourly rates depending on the funding mode of the customer.

I'm operating stut-it alone, besides a long term, part-time employment. Therefore

* I cannot assure quick response times (1-3 days rather than 2-4 hours).
* I may be unreachable for some periods of time, e.g. during business trips, vacation or sickness.
* I prefer email or messengers (Threema, Telegram, Skype) to the telephone as a method of communications.
