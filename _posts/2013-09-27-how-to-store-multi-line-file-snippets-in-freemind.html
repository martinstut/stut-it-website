<p>Every now and then, I need to document computer code, such as a configuration defined by text files, including snippets of code (2 - 30 lines) in the documentation. I do like using <a title="project home page" href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">FreeMind</a> as a fast editing tool to collect information and thoughts. But usually, nodes in mind maps are just keywords or text snippets with little formatting. So I was looking for a way to include multi-line code snippets in mind map nodes that require preserving line breaks and whitespace.</p>
<p>It turned out to be easier than I thought:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the node, about to contain the file snippet, with the long text editor (Alt+enter).</li>
<li>When asked whether you want to use formatting (bold, italic, etc.), click "yes". The editing window will open.</li>
<li>Near the bottom of the editing windows, click on the HTML-code-view tab. You'll see plain HTML code.</li>
<li>Move the cursor to the place where you want to insert the configuration file snippet.</li>
<li>Enter this code:
<pre>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</pre>
</li>
<li>Move the cursor between &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;/pre&gt;</li>
<li>Copy the code you want to insert from the source.</li>
<li>Paste it between &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;/pre&gt; .</li>
<li>Switch back to layout view and continue editing/saving etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course you can adopt this to your style of work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of pasting into the HTML code, you can leave some indicator text, switch to layout view and paste the code into layout view.</li>
<li>You can create a template node using this method and then copy it to other places of use.</li>
<li>Instead of &lt;pre&gt;, you can try &lt;code&gt;, but I found that &lt;pre&gt; works better.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm pleased with the versatility offered by FreeMind.</p>
