<p>Because I wanted to document a few things about Android apps, I was looking for an app to take screenshots. Unfortunately, a search in the market revealed, that the few screenshot apps that exist, all require you to root you phone. I'm not planning to do this on my HTC Desire, because it would void the warranty and might even render the device useless.</p>
