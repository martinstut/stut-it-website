<p>For about 9 years now I'm using a set of linked HTML files as information storage. As an editor I use the little known <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/">Amaya</a>. Being the testbed of the WWW consortium, it produces the cleanest HTML I can think of.</p>
<p>HTML files are great in portability (synchronize the collection with your USB pen), access granularity (place less public stuff in a less public subdirectory, protected by .htaccess or similar) and longevity (HTML will probably still be readable in 20 years by then current software).<br />
Searching can be done classic search engines like <a href="http://www.htdig.org/">ht://Dig</a>, although that won't work on a netbook. A desktop search engine might help, but I don't like Google search because of privacy concerns and Windows search because of it's power requirements.</p>
<p>What I feel making them hard to use is the relatively large effort required to add a new page. I need to create a new page, create a link to the parent page, edit the parent page, create a link to the child page and only then I can start writing down my quick note. To me, that kind of effort is acceptable when adding documentation about a stabilized component to the corporate intranet, but not for 3 lines about a twist that might or might not work.</p>
<p>After 9 years of continuous information adding, some stuff needs to be reorganized. But with HTML files, this is inadequately hard, at least without the right tools, none of which I found up to now. Perhaps I'll program some of them sometime. If I just want to rename the file name of a single page, I need to find all pages that have a link to the to-be-renamed page and change the link in every single one of them. If I want to move 15 pages into a different subdirectory, that's more of a project than a quick maintenance task. <span style="font-weight:bold;">This needs tools</span>.</p>
<p>Does anyone of you readers have any idea where to search for tools?</p>
