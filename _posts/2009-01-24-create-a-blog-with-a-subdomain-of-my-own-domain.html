<p>All of this is already written in the online help of blogger.com, but I found it noteworthy how easy this is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to www.blogger.com and create a blog. For the time being assign it a-temporary-name.blogger.com.</li>
<li><span style="font-style:italic;">Arrange a CNAME record for the (sub)domain of your future blog to point to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:courier new;">ghs.google.com</span><span style="font-style:italic;">.</span> I did that through the administration interface of my shared hosting account with <a href="http://www.hetzner.de/">Hetzner</a>, so now orgblog.stut.de is a CNAME to ghs.google.com.<br />
Because it was a new (sub-)domain of an existing domain, as opposed a new or changed domain, the entry spread across the Internet within less than a minute.</li>
<li style="font-style:italic;">Enter your domain in the 'Custom Domain' option on the Settings | Publishing tab.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. You can now look at my new brainchild using a stut.de address.</p>
