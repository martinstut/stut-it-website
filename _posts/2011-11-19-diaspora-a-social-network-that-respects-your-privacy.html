<p>Many people want some kind of social networking, but don't like the (non-)privacy style of Facebook.</p>
<p>There is an alternative being developed: Diaspora. I have heard of it, but when a friend told me his Diaspora address, I had a hard time getting started, so I'll try to share some useful links:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tutorial and introduction: <a title="Tutorial and Introduction" href="http://differentcomputers.com/diaspora-user-tutorial" target="_blank">http://differentcomputers.com/diaspora-user-tutorial</a></li>
<li>Step-by-step tutorial for getting started: <a title="Tutorials" href="http://diasporial.com/tutorials" target="_blank">http://diasporial.com/tutorials</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to join, you'll either need an invitation or a pod (roughly equivalent to a server) that'll accept users without invitation. One of those is <a title="diasp.org" href="https://diasp.org/" target="_blank">diasp.org</a>.</p>
<p>They say, it's not yet ready for the masses. I can confirm this, because there are still a lot of server errors.</p>
