<p>In <a href="http://stut-tech.blogspot.com/2009/02/personal-notetaking-with-tiddlywiki.html">one of my previous posts</a>, I wrote about <a href="http://mptw.tiddlyspot.org/">TiddlyWiki MPTW-Style</a>. Back then in February I started using another TiddlyWiki variant, called MonkeyGTD, as a to-do list structuring tool. I use Thinking Rock in the office and would like to have something different at home, to avoid being reminded too often of the huge backlog of work in the office.</p>
<p>MonkeyGTD uses the taggly tagging technique of MPTW to link tasks with projects, areas, realms etc. This way it is really easy to put your to-do list into a structure. I really needed to read the documentation before starting, but I got rewarded by knowing how to arrange lots of tasks into imaginable chunks.</p>
<p>For my style of use, the major drawback of MonkeyGTD is the lack of sorting orders. With a dozen projects, each having several possible next actions, I'm overwhelmed by the quantity of possible next actions. I want a system that makes an educated suggestion of what to do next. MonkeyGTD has the option of staring projects and actions, but that is only a little help to me.</p>
