<p>On <a href="http://web.appstorm.net/how-to/simplenote-the-power-of-plain-text/" target="_blank">http://web.appstorm.net/how-to/simplenote-the-power-of-plain-text/</a> I read about simplenote. The description looked interesting enough to make me check how it compares to catch.com, my current favorite, so I signed up for a free account on simplenoteapp.com. Their product seems to run on <a href="https://simple-note.appspot.com/" target="_blank">https://simple-note.appspot.com/</a> .</p>
<p>I ended up comparing a bunch of Simplenote clients for Android with catch.com. Because I don't have permanent network connectivity (e.g. not in speeding trains in rural areas or inside concrete buildings), I put emphasis on clients capable of offline operation with occasional synchronization.</p>
<ul>
<li>AndroNoter: lean and mean, nice widget, but no tagging support</li>
<li>JadeNote: tagging available, but no widget.</li>
<li>All other clients have ads, which I just can't stand in an app that's the core of my self-organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>No client comes even close to catch.com, so I'll stick with that.</p>
