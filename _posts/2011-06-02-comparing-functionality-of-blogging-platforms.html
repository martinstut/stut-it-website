<div class="posterous_autopost">
<p>With accounts at posterous.com, blogger.com and wordpress.com, I need to decide on a platform. One factor in deciding is the feature set of each platform, including the android client available. Here is the table of my test results:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Posterous</th>
<th>Blogger</th>
<th>Wordpress</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>automatic posting to Twitter, other blogs, social networks</th>
<td><strong>yes, many services</strong></td>
<td><strong>not possible</strong></td>
<td>a few services (Twitter, Facebook, Yahoo Updates, Messenger Connect)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>search engine positioning of your posts</th>
<td>poor</td>
<td>good</td>
<td><strong>best</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Creating a Draft on the Mobile</th>
<td>click the tiny "i" to mark the post as private.<br />
Later, when on the web, edit the post options (top right in a light gray, next to media) to make the post public.</td>
<td>click "Save as Draft"</td>
<td>set status as "Draft" before saving</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Editing a Draft on the Mobile</th>
<td><strong>not possible</strong></td>
<td>straightforward</td>
<td>straightforward</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Drafts when Editing on the Web</th>
<td>Save (don't publish yet) and then click Cancel. When warned about unsaved content, accept to leave the page.</td>
<td>Click "Save", not "Publish Post".</td>
<td>While composing, set the status to "Draft".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>H1, H2 headings</th>
<td>Not offered in the online editor. You are able to enter these codes in raw HTML view. H1 becomes right adjusted - not looking nice.</td>
<td>Not offered in the online editor. You are able to enter these codes in raw HTML view. Looks good.</td>
<td>Offered in the online rich text editor. Looks good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Tables</th>
<td>Not offered in the online editor. You are able to enter these codes in raw HTML view. Looks good.</td>
<td>Not offered in the online editor. You are able to enter these codes in raw HTML view. Looks good.</td>
<td>Not offered in the online editor. You are able to enter these codes in raw HTML view. <strong>Looks bad, because THs are silently removed.</strong></td>
</tr>

<p>Browsing the web for information, I stumbled across a blog post by novel writer <a href="http://www.novelpublicity.com/author/emlyn-chand/" target="_blank">Emlyn Chand</a>:Â  <a href="http://www.novelpublicity.com/2011/01/is-wordpress-or-blogspot-the-better-choice-for-hosting-your-writing-blog-heres-the-run-down/" target="_blank">Which is better, WordPress or BlogSpot? See how they stack up here</a> . The bottom line is: both have different strengths, it depends on your goal.</p>
