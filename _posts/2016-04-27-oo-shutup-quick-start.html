<p>If you want to get a quick start on O&amp;O Shutup to stop your Windows 10 computer from telling Microsoft everything you do, without spending time to understand how the O&amp;O developers meant things to work, here are the points:</p>

<h2>Get the Current Version</h2>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Download the current version from <a class="https" title="https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10" href="https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10">https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10</a> , saving the downloaded OOSU10.zip file e.g. to your Downloads folder. Don't skip this step, because a three month old version is not checking for new settings of the newest update of Windows 10.</li>
<li>Unpack (extract) OOSU10.ZIP, e.g. by right clicking in an explorer windows and executing "Extract all", checking the box "Show Files after Extracting". This will open an explorer window.<br />

</ol>
<h2>Run it</h2>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Log in as a user with administrative rights.</li>
<li>Double click on OOSU10.exe.</li>
<li>Accept the UAC request for administrative rights.</li>
<li>Click on the "Actions" button near the top, second from left.</li>
<li>Select "Apply all recommended settings"<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-345" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ooshutup-actionsapply.png" alt="OOShutup-ActionsApply" width="720" height="600" /></li>
<li>Say "yes" to "Do you want to create a system restore point". Depending on your computer's setup, restore points may not be enabled at all. In that case, follow the prompts to enable system restore points.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are not technically inclined, you can stop now. All changes recommended by O&amp;O for every computer have been made.</p>
<h2>Optional: Check advanced settings</h2>
<p>Scroll through the lines with red switches and think whether or not you want to flip them. If you want to know what a certain line would do, click on the line's name to open a short description. The good readability of these descriptions is one of the reasons why I'm recommending O&amp;O Shutup.<br />
Lines to consider to flip (set to green) might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft SpyNet membership disabled</li>
<li>Submitting data samples to Microsoft disabled</li>
<li>Reporting of malware infection disabled</li>
<li>Sending URLs from apps to Windows Store disabled</li>
<li>Sensors for locating the system and its orientation disabled</li>
<li>Windows Geolocation Service disabled</li>
<li>App access to your location disabled</li>
<li>Microsoft OneDrive disabled (unless, of course, you are using OneDrive)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Close it</h2>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>click on File / Exit.</li>
<li>If asked, reboot your computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. In my opinion, this is as easy as it can get. Thanks to O&amp;O, especially for the "Apply all recommended settings" option.</p>
