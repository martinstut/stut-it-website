<p>At first glance, the idea is appealing. I can create a blog post very easy, not much sorting effort. Finding stuff back is done by search options, enhanced by the tagging (label) logic. It might even work on the road, e.g. with the Gears support of wordpress.com.<br />
But a blog is too open. Everybody in the world can read everything. If there is a privacy option, it is too coarse, like "invited members only, for every post".<br />
So in my opinion, a blog is good for general ideas, like the one you are reading just now, but not suitable for specific internal documentation.</p>
