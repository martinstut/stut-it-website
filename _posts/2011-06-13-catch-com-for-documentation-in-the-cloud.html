<p>For almost a year now I'm using <a href="http://catch.com" target="_blank">catch.com</a> for taking quick notes. It's available on the web (everything https by default) and as an Android app (slightly more functions than on the web; didn't check other platforms).</p>
<p>It is geared towards being really quick when taking notes, jotting down that quickly fading thought. There is a widget for Android, reducing the effort to just one single click (get the focus on the text widget).</p>
<p>A note can be assigned multiple tags, useable for comfortable filtering, both on the web and on the Android app. The Android app can also assign a reminder (alarm) date/time to a note.</p>
<p>The Android app can reliably work offline and sync to the cloud later, when connectivity comes back.</p>
<p>In my view, catch.com is a great system for taking notes, if you can live with the privacy limitations of a cloud service.</p>
