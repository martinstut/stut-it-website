<div class="posterous_autopost">
<p>After reading about posterous, I decided to give it a try. My first impression is, well, impressed. For a first try, I set up a site, designed to be a single source for all my blogs - admittedly, some of them started as tests. In particular, the autopost function is nice to keep all the social channels updated.</p>
<p>Let's see whether I manage to write more now than I did before.</p>
<p>Posterous makes blogging simple, but less flexible. The mobile app can't edit posts. To discover issues like these, I started a comparison of blogging platforms in my next post.</p>
