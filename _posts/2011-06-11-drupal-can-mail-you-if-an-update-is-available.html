<p>A simple feature, but really useful if you run a Drupal website: in admin/reports/updates/settings you can enter a list of email addresses. Whenever the internal mechanism of Drupal learns about an available update for one on the components you run, you'll get an email. This is better than subscribing to mailing list, because a mailing list would notify you about hundreds of extensions you don't run.</p>
