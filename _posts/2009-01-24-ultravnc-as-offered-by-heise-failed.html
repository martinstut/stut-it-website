<p>The German IT publishing house <a href="http://www.heise.de/" target="_blank">Heise</a> is offering a service to create an UltraVNC client that's customized to connect to <span style="font-style:italic;">your</span> server: <a href="http://www.heise.de/netze/tools/fernwartung" target="_blank">http://www.heise.de/netze/tools/fernwartung</a> (German language only). Because I often need to help other computer users by remote access, the prospect of distributing a single exe file, which is able to establish a connection without installation, was appealing. So I decided to give the service a try.</p>
<p>I visited the URL, entered my home dyndns address and phone number, clicked on the download button and got the customized program as ctsupport.exe (c't ist the name of a German computer magazine, published by Heise). I transferred it to a virtual Windows 2000 machine. Of course I had setup my home router to forward incoming TCP connections on port 5500 to my client PC.</p>
<p>On the test machine, simulating someone in want of help, I double clicked the ctsupport.exe file, selected the single available connection (my server) and got connected - but only TCP-wise. The listener on my linux box did write about the connection, but did neither open a window nor write an error message. Apparently an UltraVNC server does not cooperate with any VNC-style viewer.<br />
A glance at the Heise documentation says: "on Linux helper PCs use vncviewer". I had tightvncviewer, so that may have caused the problem. I noticed, that I already had vncviewer installed, so I simply tried <code>vncviewer -listen</code> on the helper PC, but the problem persisted: TCP connection established, but no windows opening and no error message on the client (helper).</p>
<p>At that point I decided to give up on the Heise tool and stick with "classic" TightVNC.</p>
