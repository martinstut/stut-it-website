<p>Earlier this year, I discovered <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a>, a single file personal wiki. It's all in one HTML file, loaded with lots of JavaScript code. Because it's open source, there are several variants. The ones I like best are <a href="http://mptw.tiddlyspot.com/">MPTW</a> (can create automatic cross references and hierarchies by smart use of tagging) and <a href="http://monkeygtd.tiddlyspot.com/">MonkeyGTD</a> (a Getting Things Done system based on MPTW). I <a href="http://stut-tech.blogspot.com/2009/02/personal-notetaking-with-tiddlywiki.html">wrote about it already in my tech-blog</a>.</p>
<p>I feel it's great for taking structured notes, but a bit hard to maintain for larger (&gt; 100 pages) collections of information.<br />
Using it on the road is easy - just open the HTML file in Firefox or another supported browser.<br />
It's great for synchronizing between computers using a USB pen drive (just place and edit the single HTML file in your synchronized folder).<br />
Finding stuff is easy too - it has a built-in search facility.<br />
In MPTW it's easy to create a new note by opening the parent node (you can show a multi-level list of child nodes) and click on "new here".<br />
It is easy to keep the data confidential, because the you just don't share that single big HTML file.</p>
<p>Sharing the entire collection read only is easy: put the HTML file on a static web server. On a file server, or on a specially prepared web server like tiddlyspot.com, there would even be read-write capability, but always for the entire collection.<br />
Sharing only parts of the information with others is hard, because it's hard to split a single file. In theory TiddlyWiki has a mechanism to synchronize single tiddlers (the equivalent of the pages of a "classic" wiki) with a web server, but I never got that working. Perhaps I did not try hard enough.</p>
<p>So TiddlyWiki is great for small-scale personal note taking, but not for information that's supposed to be available for others to read (and perhaps even edit).</p>
