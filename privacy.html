---
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>This data privacy declaration informs users about the type, amount and purposes of collection and use of personally identifiable data by the responsible offerer Martin Stut, DÃ¼nsbergstr. 38, 35043 Marburg, Germany (<a href="contact.html">see contact page</a>) on this website (subsequently called "offering").</p>
<p>The regulations relevant for data privacy are in the German federal data privacy law (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, BDSG) and the telemedia law (Telemediengesetz, TMG).</p>
<h2>Access Data / Server Log Files</h2>
<p>The offerer (or his web space provider) is collecting data about every access of the offering (so-called server log files). Access data consist of:
<ul>
	<li>name of page requested</li>
	<li>file name</li>
	<li>date and time of the request</li>
	<li>amount of data transferred</li>
	<li>information about successful request</li>
	<li>type and version of browser, operating system of the requesting computer</li>
	<li>referrer URL (previously visited page)</li>
	<li>IP address and requesting provider.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The offerer is using the log data only for statistical evaluation for the purpose of operation, security and optimization of the offering. The offerer reserves the right to further analyse log data at a later time, if there are concrete indications causing justifiable suspicion of unlawful use.</p>

<h2>Revocation, Modifications, Corrections and Updates</h2>
<p>The user has the right to receive, upon request, free of charge information about the personally identifiable data stored about him. Additionally, the user has the right to correct incorrect data, locking and deletion of his personally identifiable data, as far as there is no lawful obligation to store the data.</p>
